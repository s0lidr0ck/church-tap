## What is Church Tap?

Church Tap is a digital engagement platform that transforms how religious communities share and interact with daily spiritual content. Using NFC-enabled bracelets or direct web access, your congregation can instantly access daily verses, participate in community prayers, and engage with shared content‚Äîall through their smartphones.

Think of it as your church's spiritual companion that's always available in your pocket, activated with just a simple tap.

No! The platform works through any web browser and can be added to phone home screens for an app-like experience without app store downloads.

### "What if someone doesn't have NFC on their phone?"
Members can bookmark your church's direct web link. The experience is identical whether accessed via NFC tap or direct web browsing.

The platform is designed for privacy. Community sharing is anonymous, no personal information is required for basic usage, and member data is protected with industry-standard security.
