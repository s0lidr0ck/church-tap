### Content Best Practices
- **Keep text concise**: Mobile screens are small
- **Use clear, readable fonts**: Especially for image verses
- **Test on phones**: View content as your members will see it

## Step 4: Set Up NFC Bracelets

### Understanding NFC Setup
NFC bracelets contain small chips that can store a web address. When someone taps their phone to the bracelet, it automatically opens that website.

### Ordering NFC Bracelets
**Option 1 - Pre-Programmed**: Order bracelets already programmed with your church's URL
**Option 2 - Blank Bracelets**: Purchase blank NFC bracelets and program them yourself
**Option 3 - NFC Stickers**: More affordable alternative that can be attached to any item

### Programming NFC Tags Yourself
1. **Download NFC App**: 
   - iOS: "NFC Tools" or "TagInfo"
   - Android: "NFC Tools" or "Trigger"
2. **Open the App**: Select "Write" or "Program" mode
3. **Choose URL Type**: Select "Website" or "URL" option
4. **Enter Your URL**: 
   - Simple: `https://yourchurch.churchtap.com/verse`
   - Tracked: `https://yourchurch.churchtap.com/t/[unique-id]`
5. **Program Tag**: Hold phone near bracelet and tap "Write"
6. **Test**: Tap programmed bracelet with phone to verify it works

### URL Options Explained
**Simple URL** (`/verse`): 
- Always shows today's verse
- Easier to program
- Good for most churches

**Tracked URL** (`/t/[unique-id]`):
- Provides detailed analytics per bracelet
- Shows which bracelets are used most
- Better for larger churches or detailed tracking

2. **Verse Display**: Check that today's verse appears properly
